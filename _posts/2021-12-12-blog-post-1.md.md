I will be presenting my work at AGU Fall Meeting 2021 in session C35A. My undergraduate mentee, Sophia Pinter, and colleague Jessica Gagliardi will also be 
presenting their work in sessions C25C and C25E respectively. Check out the online program [here](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0), or take a look at my poster [here](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/files/AGU2021_poster_GP_1.pdf).

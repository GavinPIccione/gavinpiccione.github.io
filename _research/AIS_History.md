The timescales and triggering mechanisms of ice sheet growth and retreat remain uncertain, making it difficult to predict how the cryosphere will respond to future climate warming. One approach that Earth scientists use to address this challenge is to examine how ice sheets evolved during periods in Earth history with climate conditions similar to present and future scenarios. However, the sparse geologic record limits these reconstructions. A major component of my research aims to fill this knowledge gap by studying the geochemistry of sediments and sedimentary rocks, which record changes in ice conditions through time.

### The Antarctic Ice Sheet
One of my major research projects uses mineralogic variations in subglacial precipitates to demonstrate that the East Antarctic ice sheet responds to 
millennial-scale Antarctic climate cycles. Combining subglacial precipitate data with a model of ice sheet thermodynamics, this project showed that the Antarctic 
ice sheet thins and thickens at the margins in response to millennial-scale cycles in Antarctic climate.  To trigger this rapid ice sheet response requires ocean 
forcing to melt buttressing ice shelves, causing the ice to accelerate. This research challenges the widely held assumption of a static East Antarctic ice sheet on suborbital timescales, and links Antarctic ice sheet volume to ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere teleconnections on millennial timescales.<br/><img src='/images/RossIceShelf.jpeg'>

### The Laurentide Ice Sheet
I am a part of a team of researchers working with subglacial precipitates from Baffin Island, Canada to determine the timing of accelerated ice flow in the 
Northern Laurentide Ice Sheet. Dates from a suite of Baffin precipitates suggest that they formed during three distinct episodes of ice sheet surging that were coincident with Heinrich stadials one through three respectively. Using this dataset, weâ€™ve determined these rocks to be the first terrestrial archive of Heinrich events. These results support ocean thermal forcing as the triggering mechanism for Heinrich events.<br/><img src='/images/Baffin_ice.jpeg'>

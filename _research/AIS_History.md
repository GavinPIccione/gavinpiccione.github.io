excerpt: "Past ice sheet conditions are notoriously difficult to resolve, as the most recent ice advance razes geologic records of previous glaciations. One of my research initiatives combines geochronological and geochemical characterization of subglacial precipitates to link changes in the basal environmental to ice sheet dynamics.<br/><img src='/images/TaylorValley.jpeg'>""

The mechanisms behind ice sheet growth and retreat are part of a complex feedback between cryosphere-atmosphere-ocean teleconnections. The timescales and 
interplay of these drivers are not yet fully understood, making it difficult to predict how ice sheets will behave in the future. One way that Earth scientists 
have approached this problem is to look back at past warm periods to determine how these ice sheet responded to a given climatic event. However, a sparse geologic 
record makes these reconstructions difficult. A major component of my current research seeks to fill this knowledge gap by studying subglacial chemical 
precipitates. These samples, which form in aqueous environments at the base of ice sheets, represent a novel archive of subglacial hydrologic conditions driven 
by the overlying ice. My research leverages the precipitate record through geochronological, geochemical, and microtextural characterization to link subglacial 
environmental change to ice sheet volume fluxes.

### The Antarctic Ice Sheet
One of my major research projects uses mineralogic variations in subglacial precipitates to demonstrate that the East Antarctic ice sheet responds to 
millennial-scale Antarctic climate cycles. Combining subglacial precipitate data with a model of ice sheet thermodynamics, this project showed that the Antarctic 
ice sheet thins and thickens at the margins in response to millennial-scale cycles in Antarctic climate.  To trigger this rapid ice sheet response requires ocean 
forcing to melt buttressing ice shelves, causing ice in major Antarctic embayments to accelerate. This research challenges the widely held assumption of a static 
East Antarctic ice sheet on suborbital timescales, and links Antarctic ice sheet volume to ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere teleconnections on millennial timescales.

### The Laurentide Ice Sheet
I am a part of a team of researchers working with subglacial precipitates from Baffin Island, Canada to determine the timing of accelerated ice flow in the 
Northern Laurentide Ice Sheet. Dates from a suite of Baffin precipitates suggest that they formed during three distinct episodes of ice sheet surging, corresponding
to Heinrich stadials one through three respectively. Using this dataset, weâ€™ve determined these rocks to be the first terrestrial archive of Heinrich events. Our 
results support ocean thermal forcing as the triggering mechanism for Heinrich events.

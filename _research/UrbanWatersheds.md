The city of Providence, Rhode Island, has an industrial history that spans centuries. This industrial legacy has left the rivers running through the city—including the Blackstone, Moshassuck, West, and Woonasquatucket Rivers—heavily polluted. Additionally, the use of hazardous building materials, such as lead water pipes and paint, continues to pose health risks to Providence residents. I am leading a team of researchers at Brown University on projects focused on quantifying pollution in urban watersheds and community areas, as well as projecting how these pollution sources will evolve in response to climate change.

title: "Antarctic Subglacial Hydrology"
collection: research
permalink: /research/SubglacialHydro
excerpt: "Subglacial hydrology has a significant effect on ice sheet motion. Yet, the interaction between ice sheet dynamics and long-term changes in the subglacial hydrologic system beneath major ice sheets are virtually unconstrained. In my research, I leverage the subglacial precipitate record to reconstruct the timescales and triggering mechanisms of floods beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet."

Modern remote sensing data from the Antarctic subglacial environment reveal an active hydrologic system where water is stored in lakes and saturated sediments and is flushed towards the ice sheet margin during flooding events. These aqueous systems help regulate ice sheet flow and are significant sources of ocean solutes and nutrients. However, there is currently no geologic evidence for how the Antarctic basal hydrologic system evolves on long timescales. My research applies geochronological, geochemical, and textural analyses of subglacial precipitates to create records of past subglacial flooding in Antarctica.

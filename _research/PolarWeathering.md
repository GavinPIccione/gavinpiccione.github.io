Glaciers and ice sheets are powerful agents of physical erosion that create environmental conditions conducive for chemical weathering of bedrock. Consequently, glacial waters can strongly influence geochemical cycles and nutrient availability as they flow into downstream ecosystems. My research focuses on identifying the dominant chemical weathering reactions beneath ice sheets, assessing the biogeochemical impact of glacial chemical weathering in glacial environments, and searching for records of ice-sheet related chemical weathering in the rock record.

*Blood Falls in Taylor Valley, Antarctica, is an example of a highly evolved subglacial water that is rich in rock derived nutrients, most notably iron, which gives it its red color.*

### Ice Sheets as Weathering Agents

I am working on projects aimed at characterizing the physical and chemical weathering processes in Antarctica. In one effort, we analysed the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of a large suite (n = 49) of carbonate rocks that formed in Antarctic subglacial waters. These results describe widespread microbial carbon cycling in Antarctic basal waters, which drives both carbonate and silicate weathering beneath the ice sheet. The intensity of this subglacial weathering depends primarily on bedrock type.

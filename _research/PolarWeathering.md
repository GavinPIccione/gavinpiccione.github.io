Glaciers and ice sheets are powerful agents of physical erosion that create environmental conditions conducive for chemical weathering of bedrock. Consequently, glacial waters can strongly influence geochemical cycles and nutrient availability as they flow into downstream ecosystems. My research focuses on identifying the dominant chemical weathering reactions beneath ice sheets, assessing the biogeochemical impact of glacial chemical weathering in proglacial environments, and searching for records of ice-sheet related chemcial weathering in the rock record.

*Blood Falls in Taylor Valley, Antarctica, is an example of a highly evolved subglacial water that is rich in rock derived nutrients, most notably iron, which gives it its red color.*

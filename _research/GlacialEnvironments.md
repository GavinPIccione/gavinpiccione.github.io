Modern remote sensing of subglacial environments beneath the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets reveals dynamic hydrologic systems, where water is stored in lakes and saturated sediments and periodically flushed toward the ice sheet margins. These systems regulate ice flow and supply solutes and nutrients to the ocean, but are challenging to characterize directly due to extensive ice cover. My research uses geochronological, geochemical, and textural analyses of sedimentary archives from subglacial and proglacial environments to reconstruct biogeochemical processes and environmental conditions beneath and in front of ice sheets.

### Subglacial Hydrology
I have ongoing projects focused on establishing long-term records of subglacial flushing beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. In a recent study, we presented the first well-dated, millennial-scale record of Antarctic basal flushing. Using sedimentary analyses paired with U-series geochronology and stable isotope geochemistry, we demonstrated that subglacial water flow beneath the David Glacier catchment increased during warm climate periods. This work links centennial-scale climate change with subglacial hydrology, which may be an important process governing ice motion.[Read about this work in our recent preprint.](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.172656755.50760515)

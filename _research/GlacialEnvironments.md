Modern remote sensing of subglacial environments beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets reveals dynamic hydrologic systems, where water is stored in lakes and saturated sediments and periodically flushed toward the ice sheet margins. These systems regulate ice flow and supply solutes and nutrients to the ocean but are challenging to characterize directly due to extensive ice cover. My research uses geochronological, geochemical, and textural analyses of sedimentary archives from subglacial and proglacial environments to reconstruct biogeochemical processes and environmental conditions beneath and in front of ice sheets.

### Subglacial Hydrology
Modern remote sensing data from the Antarctic subglacial environment reveal an active hydrologic system where water is stored in lakes and saturated sediments and is flushed towards the ice sheet margin during flooding events. These aqueous systems help regulate ice sheet flow and are significant sources of ocean solutes and nutrients. I am working on a establishing long-term records for subglacial flushing beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

title: "Vein fluorite U-Pb dating demonstrates postâ€“6.2 Ma rare-earth element mobilization associated with Rio Grande rifting"

excerpt: 'We studied a suite of hydrothermal veins that crosscut the Round Top laccolith in the Trans-Pecos magmatic province of west Texas. Using
spectroscopy and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of fluorite, nacrite, and calcite, we elucidate the timing and mobilization history of REE enrichment in this important
REE deposit. These combined techniques allow us to identify at least two vein forming fluids that mobilized REE between 6 and 4 Ma'

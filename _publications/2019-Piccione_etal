title: "Vein fluorite U-Pb dating demonstrates postâ€“6.2 Ma rare-earth element mobilization associated with Rio Grande rifting"

permalink: /publication/2019-11-Piccione-etal-Geosphere
excerpt: 'We studied a suite of hydrothermal veins that crosscut the Round Top laccolith in the Trans-Pecos magmatic province of west Texas. Using
spectroscopy and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of fluorite, nacrite, and calcite, we elucidate the mineralogy and details of REE enrichment in this important
REE deposit. The combined techniques allow us to identify at least two vein forming fluids that mobilized REE between 6 and 4 Ma'

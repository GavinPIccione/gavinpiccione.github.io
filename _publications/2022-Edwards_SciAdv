 ><b>Abstract:</b><br/>During the last glacial period, the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) underwent episodes of rapid iceberg discharge, re- corded in ocean sediments as “Heinrich events” (HEs). Two competing models attempt to describe the stimulus for HEs via either internal ice sheet oscillations or external ocean-climate system forcing. We present a terrestrial record of HEs from the northeastern LIS that strongly supports ocean-climate forcing. Subglacial carbonate pre- cipitates from Baffin Island record episodes of subglacial melting coincident with the three most recent HEs, resulting from acceleration of nearby marine-terminating ice streams. Synchronized ice stream acceleration over Baffin Island and Hudson Strait is inconsistent with internal ice sheet oscillations alone and indicates a shared ocean-climate stimulus to coordinate these different glaciological systems. Isotopic compositions of these precip- itates record widespread subglacial groundwater connectivity beneath the LIS. Extensive basal melting and flush- ing of these aquifers during the last HE may have been a harbinger for terminal deglaciation.

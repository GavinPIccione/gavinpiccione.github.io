excerpt: "Throughout my time in graduate school, I volunteered at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History with my colleague [Graham Edwards](https://grahamedwards.github.io/) and Jessica Gagliardi. In this role, we hosted [monthly video streams](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/rockin-pop-up/), [a recurring blog](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/virtual-museum/rock-record/), and various pop-up museum exhibits. Our goals as museum volunteers were to promote Earth science literacy in the community, and to facilitate a long term partnership between the museum and the Earth and Planetary science department at UC Santa Cruz."

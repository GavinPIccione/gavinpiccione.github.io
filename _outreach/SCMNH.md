excerpt: "Throughout my time in graduate school, I volunteered at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History with my colleagues [Graham Edwards](https://grahamedwards.github.io/) and Jessica Gagliardi. In this role, we hosted [monthly video streams](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/rockin-pop-up/), [a recurring blog](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/virtual-museum/rock-record/), and various pop-up museum exhibits. Our goals as museum volunteers were to promote Earth science literacy in the community, and to facilitate a long term partnership between the museum and the Earth and Planetary science department at UC Santa Cruz."

Over the course of the 5 year partnership with the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History, our main community engagement efforts were monthly exhibits (called Rockin' Pop-Ups) where we would describe a geologic phenomena and community members were encouraged to bring their rocks that they wanted us to identify. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to holding these events virtually. During this time, Graham and I learned a lot about how to effectively engage the community in museum-focused Earth Science education, which we presented at the Earth Educators Rendezvous in 2022.

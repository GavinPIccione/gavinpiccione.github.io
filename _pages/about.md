I am a **geochronologist** and **geochemist** working as an NSF graduate fellow in the [Blackburn geochronology lab](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California Santa Cruz.

My research applies geochronological, isotopic, spectroscopic, and computational approaches to understand past environmental changes through proxies in the sedimentary rock record.  I am particularly interested in applying these tools to study [ice sheet evolution](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/research/IceDynamics), [subglacial hydrology](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/research/SubglacialHydro), and hydrothermal systems.

In addition to my research interests, I am passionate about doing my part to improve equity in Earth Science through DEI initiatives and accessible education. I am currently a graduate representative on the DEI committee in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at UCSC and am working to improve my abilities to foster more equitable academic spaces through the UCSC Diversity and Inclusion certificate program. I also volunteer at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History with my colleague [Graham Edwards](https://grahamedwards.github.io/), where we host [monthly video streams](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/rockin-pop-up/), [a recurring blog](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/virtual-museum/rock-record/), and various pop-up museum exhibits.

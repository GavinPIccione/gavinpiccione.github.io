I am a **geochronologist** and **geochemist** working as a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University.

---

My research applies geochronological, isotopic, spectroscopic, and computational approaches to understand past environmental changes through proxies in the sedimentary rock record.  I am particularly interested in applying these tools to study [ice sheet evolution](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/research/IceDynamics), [subglacial hydrology](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/research/SubglacialHydro), and hydrothermal systems.

In addition to my research interests, I am passionate about doing my part to improve equity in Earth Science through DEI initiatives and accessible education.

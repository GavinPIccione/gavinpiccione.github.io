I am a **geochemist** and **climate scientist** working as a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University.

---

My research focuses on the causes of climate change and its effects on Earth's surface environments. I primarily investigate how polar environments and ice sheets have responded to past climate fluctuations, and how these changes influence global biogeochemical cycles and sea level. Additionally, I have ongoing projects examining the hydroclimate of the western U.S. and the formation of critical minerals in hydrothermal systems.

I am a **geochemist** and **climate scientist** working as a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University.

My research focuses on the impact of climate change on Earth's surface environments. I primarily investigate how polar environments and ice sheets have responded to past climate fluctuations, and how these changes influence global carbon and water cycles. Additionally, I have ongoing projects examining the hydroclimate of the western U.S., industrial metal pollution in Providence watersheds, and formation of critical minerals in hydrothermal systems.

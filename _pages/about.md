I am a **geochronologist** and **geochemist** working as an NSF graduate fellow in the [Blackburn geochronology lab](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California Santa Cruz.

My research applies geochronological, isotopic, spectroscopic, and computational approaches to understand past environmental changes through proxies in the sedimentary rock record.  I am particularly interested in applying these tools to study [ice sheet evolution](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/research/IceDynamics), [subglacial hydrology](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/research/SubglacialHydro), and hydrothermal systems.

In addition to my research interests, I am passionate about doing my part to improve equity in Earth Science through DEI initiatives and accessible education. Visit my [Outreach Section](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/outreach/) to learn about my work with the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History, as well as projects I'm involved in within the Earth Science community.
